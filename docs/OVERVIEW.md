## Core Concepts

### Offline-First
All write operations are finalized locally immediately and queued for background synchronization. This ensures the app is always fast and works perfectly in areas with unstable internet.

### Active Resilience
The app "heals" itself. If a connection is lost, it waits for reconnection; if a session is idle, it refreshes the token; if a workspace update happens elsewhere, it's reflected locally without a page refresh.

### Security
Data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 (CryptoJS) and protected in transit via JWT and RLS. The system supports custom encryption keys via environment variables for maximum privacy.
